## Understand Your Current Level
The most important step to understand yourself. If needed improve your skill, strength and confidence. If you don't feel confident about anything, do a favor tjo yourself by googling and spend few minutes to read some blog or youtube videos. And then check which level you are in terms of your angular skills.

* If you can create a angular app by using angular-cli or any other seed. Also understand component, module, pipes, service, etc. you can consider yourself in the beginners level. If you don't have any clue what I am talking about, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOr1r1rSZQ8) and become beginners level.
* If you have full functional app that is deployed somewhere and/or published code in github and you understand detail about routing module breakdown, unit test, architecture, etc., you can consider yourself in intermediate level angular developer.
* If you master in lazy loading, AOT, custom directive, deployment configuration, etc. you can put yourself in the expert level.
* Rest of the people are either angular blind or angular rock star. 


## Know the Interviewer
Do a favor to yourself. Google the interviewer. Look at his/her Linkedin profile. Check his/her youtube videos, old blog that wasn't developed in years and github profile. After your research try to put the interviewer in one of the following categories.
1. Lazy interviewer asks about terminology. Sometimes they google questions and ask you from there. They mostly ask termninology related questions. Mostly old managers ask these type of questions.
2. Modest and nicer interview wants to check whether you can get the job done. and you know stuff. For this kind of interviewer look at the How category questions
3. Smart interviewer (the guy who is a senior developer for a long time and has updated blogs and videos) wants to know that you think, you compare and analyze stuff to make consious decisions. For these type of nerdy interviewer (they would love to prove you wrong. and one important tip: don't try to prove them wrong) you should study why type of questions


Research team  member as well. Search people in the linked in by the company name and then look their profile in github.
